    "# Data types in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, like in all programming languages, data types are used to classify one particular type of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important because the specific data type you use will determine what values you can assign to it and what you can do to it (including what operations you can perform on it).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video, we will go through the important data types native to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not an exhaustive investigation of data types, but will help you become familiar with what options you have available to you in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be covering each data type in detail in the coming videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Data Types: An Overview\n",
    "One of the most crucial part of learning any programming language is to understand how data is stored and manipulated in that language. \n",
    "\n",
    "**_As the name suggests, a data type is the classification of the type of values that can be assigned to variables._**\n",
    "\n",
    "Users are often inclined toward Python because of its ease of use and the number of versatile features it provides. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of those features is **Dynamic Typing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many programming languages, variables are statically typed. That means a variable is initially declared to have a specific data type, and any value assigned to it during its lifetime must always have that type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in Python are not subject to this restriction.<br>\n",
    "**_In Python, a variable may be assigned a value of one type and then later re-assigned a value of a different type._**"
